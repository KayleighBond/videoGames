      <h2>Game Description</h2>

      <p>
        Sea of Thieves is a first-person multiplayer game in which players cooperate
        with each other to explore an open world via a pirate ship. ... The game
        features a progression system that only unlocks cosmetic items as the
        development team wanted to encourage both casual and experienced players
        to play together.

      <h2>My Personal Opinions And Thoughts On The Game</h2>

      <p>
        This game is second on my favorite game list. It is such a fun game to
        be able to just chill with your friends and play. You get your pirate ship
        and get your crew together. You can vote on what kind of task you would
        like to do and then sail the seas. There are several diffent tasks you could
        chose from, my favorite is the ghost ship one. You just sink all the ghost
        ships that you see. I also really enjoy the riddle ones, but they can be
        really difficult. They are very time consuming and after a few hours of
        trying to figure them out I usually just end up looking up the answer online.
