      <h2>Game Description</h2>

      <p>
        The entire focus of Friday the 13th: The Game is multiplayer. Survival is
        entirely up to you, the player, as you either stealthily hide from Jason
        or work together as a team to escape or bring the fight to Jason. Playing
        as a counselor is all about risk and reward, giving players multiple means
        of triumph over Jason!

      <h2>My Personal Opinions And Thoughts On The Game</h2>

      <p>
        It is not my first choice as a game to play. But it is not the worst, it
        is super fun if you have a group of friends to play with. It is easy to
        learn how to play. And I personally really like the back story. I think
        I have played this like a total of 5 times.
