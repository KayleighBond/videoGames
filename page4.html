      <h2>Game Description</h2>

      <p>
        Save the World is a player-versus-environment cooperative game,
        with four players collaborating towards a common objective on various
        missions. ... When they land, they must scavenge for weapons, items, resources,
        and even vehicles while trying to stay alive and to attack and eliminate other
        players.
      </p>

      <p>
        This video game has two completely different parts to it. The first part of
        the game is Save the World which is where you build to defend whatever it
        is that you are trying to protect during that mission. And then you fight
        off a bunch of waves of zombies and the better you are the higher up you
        are in the game, the more difficult it gets to kill the zombies and they
        fight back. You also collect a bunch of different types of resources in
        order to build the weapon blueprints that you collect. You can also build
        traps and other sorts of stuff to help you defend and kill all the zombies.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second part of the game is the Battle Royale portion. When it came out
        is when the game began to get all of its hype. It is a multiplayer game
        which you jump out of a battle bus and fly to where you would like to begin
        your match. From there you find weapons and other things such a boogie bombs
        and cars for mobility to get around the map. You eliminate all the other
        people in the lobby to earn the Victory Royale. If you had gotten eliminated
        you could just reque and go again. Customization of oyur character with the
        things you have earned is an option. There is also an 100 tier battle pass,
        you can get game currency, skins, weapon skins, and much more from just
        playing the game.

      <h2>My Personal Opinions And Thoughts On The Game</h2>

      <p>
        When this game first came out I absolutely loved it, well the Battle Royale part.
        I was very bad but I kept playing every single day after school until
        atleast 1 in the morning. There was a point in time when if someone put
        up a ramp and wall, you knew they were a good player and you should just
        leave the game. Now you see people building to sky height during a battle.
        Once people started to become good at the game, you had to progress quickly
        in order to keep up and even have a chance to win a match. The first 3
        seasons were my favorite. They were chill and you did not have to sweat
        just to play a game. I continued to play a rediculous amount up until chapter
        2. I just quit after chapter 2 began because in my opinion they have ruined
        the game and it is not even fun anymore. I have spent so much money on
        my account, I would say it is probably close to 4 or 5 hundred dollars.
        And I dont really have much to show for it either, besides well over 100 skins.
