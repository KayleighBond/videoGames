      <h2>My Personal Opinions And Thoughts On The Game</h2>

      <p>
        This is my absolute most favorite game ever. I have 1058 hours played as of
        9/23/2020. I spent the entire quarantine playing and I don't regret it at all.
        I made a ton of new friends and we as a tribe worked so hard to become alpha
        of the server durning 3 different seasons and we accomplished our goals.
        This is a game that you have to be dedicated to if you are going to play online.
        You build your own base and deck it out with turrets and other things in
        in order to protect yourself, your dinosaurs, and your tribemates. You tame
        your own dinosaurs and use them to help you gather materials so you can
        continue expanding,to fight other tribes, or the bosses so that you can get
        element which allows you to upgrade to tek. A new season on the server that
        we played on came out about every 1 1/2 to 2 months the very first thing we
        did was we would split our tribe in half. Half of us would gather supplies
        and spam off where we were wanting to build. While the other half would go
        and get good dinosaurs and collect drops. The drops allowed us to have armor
        and other good supplies for just beginning. The dinosaurs where tamed and
        then taken straight to the obelisk so that we could fight the boss so that
        we could progress faster than the others in order to get ahead. This game
        is very angering at times due to the fact that other tribes are trying to
        take you and your tribe out at all times. If someone finds you out and about
        by yourself, chances are they are going to kill you and your tame then take
        all your stuff. Then it is time to either restart if you had just begun,
        or go back to your base and prepare to fight. If they dont come after you
        and your base, personally I hunt them down and wipe them as soon as possible.
