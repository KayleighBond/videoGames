      <h2>Game Description</h2>

      <p>
        Realm Royale is a free-to-play third-person shooter battle royale game
        developed by Heroic Leap Games. The game features multiple character
        classes each with unique abilities. It is a spin-off of the hero shooter
        Paladins, where it originated as a game mode known as Paladins:
        Battlegrounds.

      <h2>My Personal Opinions And Thoughts On The Game</h2>

      <p>
        I really enjoyed playing Realm Royale. When it came out I hadn't seen any
        games like it, it was definitely its own game. Its alot different from other
        games also.In the beginning you choose what class you would like to play
        such as warrior, Mage, Engineer, or assassin. You open chests to find
        weapons, heath and shield potions, and abilities. You could destroy what
        you or your teammates do not want including armor. When you destroy the
        objects it will in turn give you shards and you may use them at a forge.
        You can buy health and shield potions, armor, a random legendary weapon,
        A random class ability, or a random class weapon. You can only carry 200
        shards at a time. Your teammates can resurrect you buy spending shards
        at the forge. While this being said, when you are "downed" you turn into
        a chicken, your teammates can not revive you. They must protect you until
        the timer ends and then you will be back into the game. For the most part
        this game is very fun to me, and I really enjoyed playing it.
