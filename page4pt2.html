      <h2>My Personal Opinions And Thoughts On The Game</h2>

      <p>
        I found out about this game when some of my old friends messaged me and
        told me I should download it and play with them because it is a good game
        that I would enjoy and also get mad at (They like to make me mad on purpose).
        The game is really good and still in the beta form. So far there is a solo
        and trio option and they are working on duos. I would really like to see the
        game become a 4 player game. With having only 42 players in each lobby it
        sure does get crazy. There is almost always someone to fight. The whole game
        is wizards casting spells in order to elimate the others. Something that I
        found out the hard way is that team killing is on as of right now.
